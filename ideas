Loose ideas:
	Leaders get multiple tiers of ability, party "formation" determines
	whether you get low-tier abilities from multiple leaders or multiple
	abilities from one.

	Possibly party "role" slots determining damage/healing/hp allocation?

	Limit operations by something other than time:
		# of swaps?
		distance drawn?
		something like "action points"?
