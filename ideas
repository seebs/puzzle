Loose ideas:
	Leaders get multiple tiers of ability, party "formation" determines
	whether you get low-tier abilities from multiple leaders or multiple
	abilities from one.

	Health: Maybe you should get temp hit points from enemies or something?

	Possibly party "role" slots determining damage/healing/hp allocation?

	Limit operations by something other than time:
		# of swaps?
		distance drawn?
		something like "action points"?

	Party roles:
		author (special author traits)
		protagonist (1-3 traits)
		antagonist (1-2 traits)
		bit players (no traits)

		A single slot can have more than one role. Author-only slot does
		not contribute combat stats.

		Parties can have up to 6 slots, but some will have fewer.

	Element Slots:
		protagonist, antagonist, author, character

	Formations:
		Anecdote: Single character, author/protagonist/character (1 trait)
		Collaboration: 2 authors, 1 protagonist/character (2 trait)
		Mary Sue: Single author/protagonist (3 trait), plus bit players

	Stats:
		attack (genre)
		defense (genre)
		health (genre) => call "inspiration" (enemy damage "word count"?)
		tropes (active or passive)

		flagged stats:
			protagonist
			antagonist
			character
			narrator
			support
		protagonist traits (up to 3)
		antagonist traits (up to 2)
		author trait (?)
	Party:
		"cast"
		-- elements slots with flags on them

	Genres:
		romance (heart, red)
		fantasy (wizard's hat, orange)
		action (explosion, yellow)
		scifi (atom, green)
		crime (dagger blue)
		gothic (bat, purple)
	
	Defense:
		dmg = dmg / (pow(2, defense/damage))
		shielding of some sort (presumably pre-defense)
